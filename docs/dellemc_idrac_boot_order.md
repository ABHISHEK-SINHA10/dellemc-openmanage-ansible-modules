| bios_boot_seq  |   no  |  []  | |  List of boot devices' FQDDs in the sequential order for BIOS Boot Sequence. Please make sure that the boot mode is set to C(Bios) before setting the BIOS boot sequence.  Changing the BIOS Boot Sequence will restart the server  |

If I(boot_once) is set to C(Enabled), the system boots from the selected device only once. Subsequently, the system boots according to the BIOS Boot sequence.  The C(F11), C(BIOS), C(F10), and C(UEFIDevicePath) options only support boot once, that is, when any of these devices are set as the boot device, the server boots into the selected device and from the second reboot onwards, the system boots as per the boot order. When any of these options are selected, the I(boot_once) option is set to C(Enabled) by default and you cannot disable it.  |
| boot_once  |   |  Enabled  | <ul> <li>Enabled</li>  <li>Disabled</li> </ul> |  <ul><li>if C(Enabled), boots from the selected device only once on next reboot. Subsequently, the system will boot according to Bios/Uefi boot sequence</li><li>if C(Disabled), system will boot from the selected first boot device on next and subsequent reboots</li></ul>  |
